        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <li>1 (1 pound) whole pork tenderloin</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon extra-hot prepared horseradish</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cold butter</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh chives</li>
            </ul>
            
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Season pork with salt and pepper.</li>

                <li>Heat oil in an ovenproof skillet over high heat. 
                    Cook pork until browned on one side, 3 to 4 minutes. 
                    Turn over pork and transfer the skillet to the preheated oven. 
                    Cook until pork is browned and still slightly pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. 
                    An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Transfer pork to a plate.
                </li>
                <li>Remove any excess oil from the skillet and place it over medium-high heat. 
                    Pour in chicken broth and bring to a boil, scraping any browned bits off of the bottom of the pan. 
                    Whisk in cream, horseradish, Dijon mustard, and cayenne pepper. 
                    Continue cooking until the mixture is reduced to a thick sauce, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in cold butter. 
                    Stir in chives.
                </li>
                <li>Slice pork into 1/2-inch slices and serve topped with sauce.</li>
            </ol>
