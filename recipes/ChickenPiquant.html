        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe is a variation on traditional chicken piquant which is spicy Cajun chicken.

            </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's®)</li>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) package boneless, skinless chicken breast tenders</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®)</li>
                <li>¼ cup diced sweet pickles</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons drained capers</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix flour and Creole seasoning together in a shallow bowl. Dredge chicken through the flour mixture, shaking off excess.</li>

                <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-heat. 
                    Cook chicken in the hot oil until browned, about 2 minutes per side. 
                    Add diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, pickles, vinegar, capers, and garlic to chicken; 
                    simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes more.
                </li>
            </ol>
